C# Unity Group Project


<h2>Project Description:</h2>

- Forest Frenzy is a fast paced, action-packed 3D Arcade game. The game is inspired by the fast-paced, dynamic and fun spirit of WindJammers, the game is designed to challenge players to hit as many targets with their boomerang in a flamboyant forest - The Forest is filled with various different obstacles and power-ups.  Players are tested on their swiftness and their quick reaction; each player has a time limit.  A turn-taking multiplayer, where each player is able to make it onto the scoreboard with their highest score.

<h2>Contribution:</h2>

- For this Group Project, I was the lead Programmer, I've developed the backbone of the gameplay Loop, Such as:
  
    -  Producing scripts like Level Manager, to manage core gameplay variables, such as Increasing Level Difficulty, handling beehive spawn rate and the player taking damage.
    -  Scoreboard Manager, that saves a highscore each playthrough, so players are able to compete for the first position in the highscore. Highscore is saved locally on the machine everytime the game is booted up. 
    -  Falling Objects, that deals damage to players. That spawns at different times at different spawn locations based on the players location.
